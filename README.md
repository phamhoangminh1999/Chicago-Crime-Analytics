# Chicago Crime Analytics
## Introduction
This is a project which we analyse about the crime situation in Chicago, based on the data provided by Chicago Police Department. All the analytics, insights, and description about the data are presented in the notebook file.
## Data source 
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2021/dwme-t96c
## Notice
I don't upload the data file (which is crime_2021.csv) here because it is too large for the repo. If you want to approach the data, click the link about and it is easy to download the data file in any format.

I also put some text files here, which are the result of the data mining section in the notebook. It might be useful if you want to try some data mining techniques in this problem.
